    "This dataset is from `kaggle.com` and derives metadata from approximately 5000 movies from The .Movie Database (TMDb). This dataset would be good to learn on so that we can predict movie(s) that a user would like based on certain attribute labels. Attributes of the dataset are listed below:\n",

    "The number of attributes we will not be too large but the number of attributes that are not going to use to train the classifiers could be an issue. This is where the feature could be build upon such as a filtering option for predictions. Reducing the other attributes would help to simplify the training model. The rest of the attributes are necessary and required to correctly predict a movie a user would use. "
